# High-Level-Synthesis
In high-level synthesis, a tool preforms the conversion of a procedural or object-oriented programming language to hardware design at RTL level. In this way it is possible to get high level languages such as C, C++ and MATLAB to transform into VHDL or Verilog. In this project, an efficient cross-talk-preventing algorithm on the FPGA using C++ has been implemented. 

#Usage
The C++ code can be found in the SRC and FFT folder. The code has been optimized for a tool like Vivado or Catapult. Be aware that not every concept in C++ can be translated.

#Report
I made an in depth report (~50 pages) with a presentation. You can find this in the report folder. The final design and optimizations are discussed, as well as the advantages and disadvantages with high level synthesis. This can be relevant for designers.
